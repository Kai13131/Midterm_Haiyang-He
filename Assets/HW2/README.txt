HW2_0: 
- Fix the syntax of the script, look for missing characters, out of order characters, missing parentheses, etc.
- I cannot export code with errors, so I commented out parts of the script you need to correct. So to see the syntax errors delete the “//” at the start of every line commented out
HW2_1:
- Create a new script and add it to an empty game object in the scene
- In that script declare a float currentHealth variable and float regenAmount variable then
- Increase currentHealth by regenAmount every frame
- Then print currentHealth every frame
HW2_2:
- Create a new script and add it to an empty game object in the scene
- In that script declare a string firstName variable and a string lastName variable
- At the start print out the firstName and lastName as a single string together
