Using the player controller created during the lecture build on top of it and create a loop around mechanic

Create a new script that when the player walks off the side of the screen the player should appear on the opposite side

Break it down into sub-problems to solve:
- Start with just one side of the screen
- How do you know an object is off the right side of the screen?
- How do I get the object to the other side of the screen?
- Then put them together: “If the object is off the right side of the screen then get them to the other side”
- Then repeat for the other sides of the screen
