Make the jump from the doodle jump mobile game:
- In the game you can only move left and right, but when you land on a platform you will jump automatically
- For us I made the left and right movement already so you need to add the jump
- So when the green player object collides with the white platform object have the player jump (hint see how we did the flappy bird jump)
- The platforms are set to be a IsTrigger so make sure to use the correct event function
